## What This App Does

This Flutter app shows you how to create a **smart Floating Action Button** that does more than just one thing! 

Instead of the typical "add item" button, this FAB opens up a menu with multiple options - just like you see in popular apps like WhatsApp, Google Keep, or Twitter.

### Key Features
- **Interactive FAB**: Tap the floating button to see magic happen
- **Bottom Sheet Menu**: Choose from multiple actions in a clean popup
- **User Feedback**: Get instant confirmation with snackbar messages
- **Real-world Design**: Looks and feels like professional apps

### Why I Built This
I created this demo to present it in a class session in order to show that Flutter's FloatingActionButton can be much more powerful than most tutorials suggest. It's not just about adding items - it's about creating smooth user experiences


## Learning Objective
The goal of this demo is to show that the **Floating Action Button** can do much more than just ‚Äúadd items.‚Äù  
It can control real user interactions by triggering menus, forms, or navigation.  
In this example, pressing the FAB opens a **bottom sheet** that displays three real-world options:
- Send a Message  
- Upload a Photo  
- Share Something  

Each option responds with a short **SnackBar** message to show user feedback.


## Widget Description
The **FloatingActionButton** is a circular button that appears above other content in an app.  
It is used to perform the app‚Äôs **primary or most common action**.  

In Flutter, it‚Äôs built using:
```dart
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: ...,   // defines what happens when pressed
  child: ...,       // icon or text inside the button
  backgroundColor: ... // color of the button
)
